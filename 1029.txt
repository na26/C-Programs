Description
ROT R 3 ("Rotate Right by 3") is a simple substitution cipher to encode letters. Applying ROT R 3 to a piece of text merely requires examining its alphabetic characters and replacing each one by the letter 3 places further or 'right' of it along in the alphabet, wrapping back to the beginning if necessary. A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on up to W, which becomes Z, then the sequence continues at the beginning of the alphabet: X becomes A, Y becomes B, and  Z, which becomes C. Only those letters which occur in the English alphabet are affected; numbers, symbols, whitespace, and all other characters are left unchanged.

Input
One line of characters (ends with either '\n' or EOF).

Output
