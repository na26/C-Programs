Description
In the 3x3 grid below, the greatest sum of two adjacent numbers in any direction (up, down, left, right, or diagonally) is 22+23=45.

21 22 23

20 10 11

17 16 15

Input n and m. 1<=n<=100. 1<=m<=n. Then input a n x n grid. All integers in the grid are from 0 to 1000. Output the greatest sum of m adjacent numbers in any direction (along straight line only). 

You are required to use malloc to dynamically allocate just enough space for storing the grid.

Input
n, m, and then followed by a n x n grid

Output
The greatest sum of m adjacent numbers in any direction
