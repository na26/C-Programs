Description
Input three positive integers n, m, and p. Then input two matrices. The first one is a n (rows) by m (columns) matrix. The second one is a m (rows) by p (columns) matrix.

Output the matrix product (should be n rows by p columns).

You are required to store the matrices in heap memory.
